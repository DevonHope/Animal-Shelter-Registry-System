Project Description: 
  To build a GUI system for staff members to register clients and animals and then matchmake a client to an animal for optimal home situations for their pets. 

Installation/Building Instructions:
 Type in the the command in the terminal while in the current directory you untar'd the files: make (Creates and links all of the object files together to produce the executable 'cuACS')

Laucnhing Instructions:
	Type in the exact command after compiling the program: ./cuACS

If running from terminal after executing Makefile:
*  Once the program loads, it will execute code where it will create a folder (Animals) in the current directory
   It will then add the 5 animal files in the 'Animals' folder from the qrc resource file
* When you are adding an animal, a save dialog will show up and will bring you to the current directory. In there, it will show the 'Animals' folder where we store our animal files for the program to read from.
  Thus, you will need to save it there everytime you want to add an animal
* Everytime you add or delete an animal, hit the refresh button to reflect the changes
