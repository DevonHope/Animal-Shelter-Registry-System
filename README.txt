Project Description: 
  To build a GUI system for staff members to register clients and animals and then matchmake a client to an animal for optimal home situations for their pets. 

Installation/Building Instructions:
 Type in the exact commands in the Terminals:
	1. make clean (This deletes the object files)
	2. make (Creates and links all of the object files together to produce the executable 'cuACS')

Laucnhing Instructions:
	Type in the exact command after compiling the program: ./cuACS

* After execution, it will need to create it's build folder (build-cuACS-Desktop-Debug).
  Once the program loads, it will execute code where it will create a folder (Animals) in that build folder, which contains the 5 animal files in persistent storage
* When you are adding an animal, a save dialog will show up and will bring you to the build folder. In there, it will show the animals folder where we store our animal files for the program to read from
